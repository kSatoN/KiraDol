A kusoge for Android that I made a few years ago and ended up developing.

日本人の方は[日本語版](./README.md)見たほうがいいと思うよ。


## Overview

This is a 2D side-scrolling game.

It was originally made as an assignment for a seminar course when I was a university student, and it was slightly modified after that. It took me about a month and a half to two months to make it.

I hope this will be useful for those who want to make simple games for smartphones, but the recommended language for Android is now Kotlin, and we don’t use Java nowadays……

The reason why I decided to publish the source code was simply that I had lost motivation (and gained motivation for other things) and had been neglecting the project for a while, the only Android device I had was 8 years old, and I couldn’t continue development even if I had gained motivation. I thought about deleting the JDK and this project when the storage space on my development PC ran out, but I didn’t want to delete something I worked so hard on, so I decided to publish it.


## How to Play

It is not available in the store, ~~so you can build it yourself.~~ There are some image and audio materials that cannot be redistributed, so please refer to [.gitignore](./.gitignore) to collect such materials before building.

When you start the app, you will see a button “Listen to Rule”, and you can listen to the rule explanation from there.

If you want to read to the explanation right now without building the app, you can find the text in [strings.xml](app/src/main/res/values-en/strings.xml) (Not completely translated yet).
